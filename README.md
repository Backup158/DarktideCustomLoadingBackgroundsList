# THIS MIGHT KILL YOUR FPS IF YOU USE THEM ALL

For use with tickbox's [Custom Loading Backgrounds mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40kdarktide/mods/462).

Using wallpapers from Steam profile backgrounds and reuploaded art from various sources. Reuploaded wallpapers hosted on [Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/custom-loading-backgrounds-1920x1080-REhTk5C). 

# Installation
Make sure `Load Internet` is 'On' in the Mod Options. Then do one of the following:
## Method 1
Copy the relevant contents of `urls.txt` and paste it into `<Darktide Mods>/CustomLoadingBackground/scripts/mods/CustomLoadingBackground/urls.txt`

## Method 2
Download `urls.txt` and put it into the `<Darktide Mods>/CustomLoadingBackground/scripts/mods/CustomLoadingBackground` folder.

Replace the existing file. Rename the existing file if you want to use it again later (whichever is named `urls.txt` is the active one. other files won't load).

# Wallpaper Choices
The file is full of Warhammer related arts. I have included some (commented out) wallpapers as an example at the beginning. Make sure each link leads directly to the image (not just to an album).

To add your own images from some other imgur album: click 'Copy Link', paste it into `urls.txt`, add '.png' to the end of the url.

**See the comment block at the top of the file for further details.**
